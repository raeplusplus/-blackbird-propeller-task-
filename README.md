# Internship Task for Propeller via Blackbird Australia
In this task for my virtual internship with Blackbird Australia, I worked with their company Propeller (a drone-mapping, construction technology company) by using the GitHub CLI. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React

First, I created a new react app and updated the required links and files acording to the task guidelines. The GitHub CLI allowed me to preform all of the git commands, as well as create, update and approve a PR from the command line (all commands listed in the command.sh file).

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first foray into using the GitHub CLI and I learned that it is a very powerful tool for remote teams. It is so cool to be able to see all of your PRs, issues and repo overviews in the commandline to reduce the amount of context switching while working. I'm absolutely using this CLI on every project going forward.
